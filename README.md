# MPMB-UA23PT8-Weapons
Replaces the existing weapons with their updated versions in *Unearthed Arcana 2023: Player's Handbook Playtest 6*. This is being kept seperate from the main *UA23PT8* content script so that others can decide if they want to opt in or out of using these weapon updates.

**Script Credit Note:**
Almost all the content of this script is ripped directly from either "ListsGear.js" or "all_WotC_pub+UA.js" by MPMB and others. All I have done is alter the code so that the weapons match up with *UA23PT8*.

**Detailed List of Weapon Changes:**
- *Simple Weapons*
  - **Club**: Slow
  - **Dagger**: Nick
  - **Greatclub**: Push
  - **Handaxe**: Vex

  - **Crossbow, Heav**y: Push
  - **Longbow**: Slow
  - **Musket**: Slow
  - **Pistol**: Vex
  - Musket & Pistol are no longer excluded by default, since *UA23PT8* includes them
  - Though *UA23PT8* doesn't list them, the Modern firearms and Future weapons are included in this script, with the script author making educated guesses about what Mastery Property each of the below firearms/weapons will be given. The author is personally of the opinion that the Hunting Rifle, Shotgun, and Antimatter Rifle should have a modified version of the Cleave Property, but the Cleave Property can only be applied to a Melee Weapon according to *UA23PT8*, so I have not given that property to those weapons.
    - **Pistol, Automatic**: Vex
    - **Revolver**: Vex
    - **Hunting Rifle**: Slow
    - **Automatic Rifle**: Slow
    - **Shotgun**: Slow
    - **Laser Pistol**: Vex
    - **Laser Rifle**: Slow
    - **Antimatter Rifle**: Slow
  - The **Net** has also been altered in accordance with the changes made to it in *UA23PT8*.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.

**Known Bugs:**
- No known bugs at this time. Will update when any are found.
