# MPMB-UA23PT8-Weapons
This script adds code that implements the Weapon Mastery property from the 2023 Unearthed Arcana "Player's Handbook Playtest 8" article.

**Script Credit Note:**
This file has been made by MasterJedi2014, but consists almost entirely of code made by MorePurpleMoreBetter. The only code by me at this point is the code that alters the **Net**.

# This file must be loaded in before any of the following scripts for the 2022-2023 One D&D/5.1E UA articles, otherwise the sheet runs into errors:

- "MPMB-UA23PT7-Content" (https://github.com/MasterJedi2014/MPMB-UA23PT7-Content)

  - Musket & Pistol are no longer excluded by default, since *UA23PT8* includes them
  - Though *UA23PT8* doesn't list them, the Modern firearms and Future weapons are included in this script, with the script author making educated guesses about what Mastery Property each of the below firearms/weapons will be given. The author is personally of the opinion that the Hunting Rifle, Shotgun, and Antimatter Rifle should have a modified version of the Cleave Property, but the Cleave Property can only be applied to a Melee Weapon according to *UA23PT8*, so I have not given that property to those weapons.
    - **Pistol, Automatic**: Vex
    - **Revolver**: Vex
    - **Hunting Rifle**: Slow
    - **Automatic Rifle**: Slow
    - **Shotgun**: Slow
    - **Laser Pistol**: Vex
    - **Laser Rifle**: Slow
    - **Antimatter Rifle**: Slow
  - The **Net** has also been altered in accordance with the changes made to it in *UA23PT8*.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.

**Script Patch Notes:**
- **2024-04-05:**
  - Fixed the formatting for the start of each entry throughout the entire script, as I had incorrectly used ":" instead of "="; In other words, all of the entries started with *WeaponsList["name"] **:** {* instead of *WeaponsList["name"] **=** {*.
- **2024-05-13:**
  - Replaced the entire script with a new one composed of code made by user "Joost/MorePurpleMoreBetter".

**Known Bugs:**
- No known bugs at this time. Will update when any are found.
